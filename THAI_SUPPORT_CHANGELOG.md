## Testing

The new `test_thai_support.py` script tests:
1. Thai language detection
2. Thai entity extraction
3. Thai query processing
4. Hybrid retrieval with Thai content

## Installation and Setup

To use the Thai language support:

1. Run the prerequisite check:
   ```
   python check_prerequisites.py
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   ./install_thai_support.sh
   ```

3. Test the Thai language support:
   ```
   python test_thai_support.py
   ```

4. Apply the Thai language updates:
   ```
   ./update_thai_support.sh
   ```

## Future Development

Planned future improvements for Thai language support:
