This is a sample text file for testing the GraphRAG API.

The GraphRAG API combines knowledge graph and RAG capabilities to provide enhanced information retrieval and question answering.

Some key features include:
- Multi-model support for LLMs and embeddings
- Knowledge graph extraction and querying
- Hybrid retrieval combining vector and graph-based approaches
- Visualization of knowledge graphs

This test file should be processed by the API to demonstrate its capabilities.
